# MUSA550 Final Project - Group: Hang Zhao, George Chen, Ling Chen

Our project undertakes a comprehensive analysis of Hong Kong's fundamental geography, encompassing both physical and human aspects, to explore and study its climate resilience. This involves performing detailed cluster analysis to identify and understand the various district clusters, shedding light on how different areas of the city uniquely respond to environmental challenges. This deep dive into Hong Kong's geographic makeup is a crucial step in our endeavor to develop effective strategies for enhancing the city's resilience to climate change.
